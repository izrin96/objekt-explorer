## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Your posts and Post a list
A signed-in viewer's own posts SHALL be summarised above the feed in one row: the title Your posts, how many of them are listed, how many are idle, and how many can be bumped now, with a control that shows or hides the posts. Shown, each entry SHALL show:
- the lists in the post;
- whether the post is listed or idle;
- when it was last bumped;
- a Bump control.

With no choice saved in this browser, the posts SHALL start shown when any of them is idle, and hidden otherwise. Showing or hiding them SHALL be remembered in this browser, and that choice SHALL win over the default. A viewer with no posts SHALL see neither the row nor the posts.

A Post a list control SHALL open a dialog listing the viewer's have, want and sale lists, each with the same Show on Trade switch the list form offers (Show on Market on a sale list), saving at once. Turning it off SHALL also take the list out of matching, and on a sale list off Market.

A have or sale list not filed under a Cosmo profile cannot be on Trade, so its switch SHALL be disabled and say why. A signed-out visitor activating Post a list SHALL be sent to `/login?redirect=/trade`.

#### Scenario: Summary of six posts
- **WHEN** the viewer has six posts, one idle, and two can be bumped now
- **THEN** the row reads Your posts with 5 listed, 1 idle and 2 ready to bump

#### Scenario: Starts hidden when nothing is idle
- **WHEN** none of the viewer's posts is idle and they have never shown or hidden them
- **THEN** only the summary row is above the feed

#### Scenario: Starts shown when a post is idle
- **WHEN** one of the viewer's posts is idle and they have never shown or hidden them
- **THEN** the posts are listed under the summary row

#### Scenario: The choice is remembered
- **WHEN** the viewer hides the posts and later opens `/trade` again in the same browser, with a post now idle
- **THEN** the posts stay hidden, and the summary row still counts the idle post

#### Scenario: Post from the dialog
- **WHEN** the viewer turns Show on Trade on for want list "binary hunt" in the dialog
- **THEN** the list is on Trade and in matching, and appears under Your posts as bumped just now

#### Scenario: Take down from the dialog
- **WHEN** the viewer turns Show on Market off for a sale list in the dialog
- **THEN** the list leaves `/trade`, Market and For you

#### Scenario: Unbound have list
- **WHEN** the viewer's have list is not filed under a Cosmo profile
- **THEN** its switch in the dialog is disabled with the reason shown
