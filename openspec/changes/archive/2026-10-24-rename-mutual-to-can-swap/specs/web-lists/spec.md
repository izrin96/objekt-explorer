## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Find matches shortcut
On their own want list, or their own have or sale list bound to a Cosmo profile, the owner SHALL see a Find matches control in the list header. Once it is known, and only for a list that compares both ways, the control SHALL show the number of mutual people for that list: the number the Mutual option reads (Mutual N) when the link opens, so people whose posts are all idle are left out of both and the two numbers never disagree. A list that opens on Any SHALL show no number. Activating it SHALL open For you with Compare with naming that list:
- `/trade/for-you?match=mutual&list=<slug>` when the list compares both ways, because its linked list also takes part in Trade;
- `/trade/for-you?match=any&list=<slug>` otherwise.

Other visitors SHALL not see the control.

#### Scenario: Owner opens matches
- **WHEN** the owner of have list "spares", linked to want list "binary hunt", activates Find matches
- **THEN** the browser is at `/trade/for-you?match=mutual&list=spares`, with Matches on Mutual and Compare with naming "spares"

#### Scenario: Owner opens matches for a lone list
- **WHEN** the owner of sale list "duplicates" activates Find matches
- **THEN** the browser is at `/trade/for-you?match=any&list=duplicates`, with Matches on Any and Compare with naming "duplicates"

#### Scenario: Visitor
- **WHEN** a signed-in user opens someone else's have list
- **THEN** no Find matches control is shown

#### Scenario: Count agrees with Mutual
- **WHEN** have list "spares" has 3 mutual people, one of whom has only idle posts, and the owner views its header
- **THEN** Find matches reads 2, and the link opens on Mutual, its button reading "Can swap 2"

#### Scenario: Lone list has no count
- **WHEN** the owner views sale list "duplicates"
- **THEN** Find matches shows no number
