## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Hidden serials stay hidden in offers
When an entry on the recipient's list comes from a list that hides serial numbers, the offer builder's You get picker SHALL offer it only as "any copy" of its collection. Neither that entry nor the recipient's other copies of the collection SHALL be shown or pickable by serial through that entry.

A request asking for a specific objekt SHALL be refused unless that objekt is reachable through an entry on a list that shows serials, or it was under You give in the offer being countered. A copy listed only on hidden-serial lists can still be asked for as any copy.

Asking for any copy through hidden-serial entries that name specific objekts SHALL draw only on those objekts, while the recipient still holds them, transferable and unreserved. The picker's "N held" and the most copies a request may ask for SHALL count only those. An entry for the whole collection, on any list, opens every copy the recipient holds.

#### Scenario: Hidden list in the picker
- **WHEN** rin.trades's have list hides serials and lists SeoYeon 204Z #537, and the user opens You get
- **THEN** the picker shows SeoYeon 204Z as "Any copy · 1 held", with no serial and no specific copies

#### Scenario: Same collection on a visible list
- **WHEN** rin.trades also lists SeoYeon 204Z on a sale list that shows serials
- **THEN** the picker shows the specific copies from that sale list, and still no serial for the hidden list's entry

#### Scenario: Listed one, holds three
- **WHEN** rin.trades's hidden-serial list names one SeoYeon 204Z, and rin.trades holds three spare copies, none listed elsewhere
- **THEN** the picker shows "Any copy · 1 held", and a request for two copies is refused

#### Scenario: Listed token gone
- **WHEN** the only SeoYeon 204Z a hidden-serial list names has left rin.trades's wallet
- **THEN** the picker shows no SeoYeon 204Z from that list, even if rin.trades holds other copies

#### Scenario: Specific request through the API
- **WHEN** a request asks for SeoYeon 204Z #537 by its objekt id, and it is listed only on rin.trades's hidden-serial list
- **THEN** the offer is refused as unlisted, and nothing is sent

#### Scenario: Counter keeps a shown objekt
- **WHEN** rin.trades offers SeoYeon 204Z #537 under You give, and the user counters, keeping it under You get
- **THEN** the counter is sent, even though #537 is on a hidden-serial list
