## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Account-wide matches
Trade SHALL match the signed-in user, one person at a time, against the other accounts whose listed have, sale or want lists (discoverable and not idle; see `web-trade-browse` Order and idle posts) overlap the user's have, sale and want lists. This drives the header sentences and list counts on Browse and For you, Any, Mutual and Mutual N (see `web-trade-browse`). An idle list SHALL not count toward its owner. A have list counts only against a want list open to swaps, and a sale list only against a want list open to buying: a want list open to swaps only never matches a sale list, and one set to buying only never matches a have list (see `web-lists`). The user's own lists count whether or not they are discoverable. Matching SHALL use the user's have and sale lists, never everything their wallet holds: owning an objekt does not mean it is up for trade. A have or sale list SHALL take part only while it is bound to one of its owner's Cosmo profiles, since Trade checks that profile's holdings. Want lists always take part. The user's own account SHALL never be matched. Want-list alerts SHALL use the same rules for which of another account's lists take part (see `web-notifications` Want-list alerts).

#### Scenario: Matches across lists
- **WHEN** a user has two have lists and one want list, and a person's discoverable lists overlap two of them
- **THEN** the person's row counts the matched objekts from both of the user's lists in one header sentence

#### Scenario: Held but not on a have list
- **WHEN** the user holds SeoYeon 204Z but it is on none of their have lists, and a person wants it
- **THEN** SeoYeon 204Z does not count toward that person

#### Scenario: Unbound have list
- **WHEN** the user's only have list is not bound to a Cosmo profile, and a person wants a collection on it
- **THEN** that collection does not count toward the person, and Compare with does not offer the list

#### Scenario: Buying-only want list in the person sheet
- **WHEN** the user's only want list is set to Buying only, and a person's have list and sale list each hold a different collection on it
- **THEN** the person's row counts only the sale list's collection as one they have that the user wants

#### Scenario: No lists
- **WHEN** a signed-in user with no want list and no bound have list opens `/trade`
- **THEN** there is no Matches control, and a line asks them for such a list with a Post a list control

#### Scenario: Opened from Browse
- **WHEN** the user follows a link to `/trade?person=<id>`
- **THEN** that person's row leads Browse with every post shown, counted against all of the user's lists

#### Scenario: Idle list
- **WHEN** a person's only have list overlapping the user's wants is idle
- **THEN** it does not count toward that person, and the person is not listed on For you through it

#### Scenario: Signed out
- **WHEN** a visitor without a session opens `/trade?person=<id>`
- **THEN** that person's row leads Browse with no counts, and Browse shows the sign-in prompt

#### Scenario: Trade opens Browse
- **WHEN** a signed-in user opens `/trade`
- **THEN** the browser stays at `/trade` and shows the Browse feed

#### Scenario: Alerts follow the same lists
- **WHEN** a person's have list holding a collection on the user's want list is left out of For you because the user hid that person
- **THEN** a new entry on that have list creates no want-list alert for the user
